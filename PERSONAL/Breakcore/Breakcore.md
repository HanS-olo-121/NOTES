Breakcore is a [[Microgenre]] of EDM that originally came from [[Jungle]], [[Hardcore]] and [[Drum and Bass]] in the mid to late 1990s.

__Its known for its complex set of breakbeats and heavy use of sampling__

# History

Originally from Europe, its solidification started in raves and clubs. Breakcore has continuously evolved throughout its lifespan and many artists started to mix other genres to add melodic complexity while others stayed keeping it more hardcore by being more close to **industrial** or **heavy-metal**. Artists such as *Shitmat*, *Sickboy*, *DJ Scotch Egg*, and *Drop the Lime* on the other hand would mix happy hardcore and rave to give a lighter, more harmonious sound, while **[[Venetian Snares]]** would tend to take a more classical music approach. 

>In *Breakcore: Identity and Interaction on Peer-to-Peer*, sociologist Andrew Whelan notes that [[Venetian Snares]] has become "synonymous with breakcore such that alternative styles are being sidelined." He adds that breakcore is the **best example of a music genre whose development is intrinsically linked to online and peer-to-peer distribution.** [(Source)](https://dj.dancecult.net/index.php/dancecult/article/download/282/253)

### 2020 Revival

In 2020 a revival of the genre had occurred, except this was much different than the breakcore of the late 90s to mid 2000s, it was more nostalgic and atmospheric than that of its previous form. Due to the rise of the internet, and its growing popularity, it took on an aesthetic deriving from **video games, anime, and internet culture as a whole**. With artists such as [[Machine Girl]], and [[goreshit]], being major influencers to this new wave of breakcore. Early fans of breakcore would say it more closely resembles Drum and Bass. 

# Characteristics

The most defined characteristic of breakcore is the drum work, typically taking inspiration from the [[Amen Break]] and other hip-hop break beats and high BPMs. Many artists take different approaches, such as rearranging the beats or adding effects to distort and alter the timbre of the sample being used. 

>[!Important]
There is no melodic structure that actually defines breakcore, but it is most notable as a sample heavy genre taking aspects from many others across the musical spectrum in order to make a frantic and face-paced piece. 

At the turn of the century, more and more artists would use traditional synthesis techniques in order to compose more elaborate melodies. Some musicians ([[Venetian Snares]] and [[Igorrr]]), would even incorporate live recorded instruments into their works. 

# Distribution

Due to its fragmentation around the globe, it is not a genre that is centered in any one region. Most discourse and acquisition is done through peer to peer networks or internet forums due to its rapid development and growth. Whereas in its infancy it was based in very select urban cities. It is still considered quite a small genre, but in comparison to its size in the 90s, it still continues to grow rapidly
