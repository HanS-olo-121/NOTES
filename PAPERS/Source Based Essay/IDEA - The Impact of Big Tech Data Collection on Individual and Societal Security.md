**The importance of keeping yourself safe in the cyberspace.**

Cyber Security is not very well understood and the data that is stolen from you with your "consent" as most people are not as well informed on the shitty and shady practices of big tech and how to protect yourself from these.  

Why you should be more cognoscente of the data your share with companies, how they use it, and what you can do to protect yourself
