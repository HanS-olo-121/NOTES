# Main Point

Cyber Security is not very well understood and the data that is stolen from you with your "consent" as most people are not as well informed on the shitty and shady practices of big tech and how to protect yourself from these.  

Why you should be more cognoscente of the data your share with companies, how they use it, and what you can do to protect yourself

# Topics 

VPNs and how they actually work / Misinformation about them / Which ones to use (Ram based servers, Mullvad \[talk about how the Swedish government raided them and got nothing])

Google and Facebook data mining

How your browser tracks data (Maybe touch on Tor)

Linux and its benefits over Windows (and how to use Windows within Linux using virtual machines)

Convenience sacrifices security - 2FA, Learning curve difficulties. 

# Random thoughts to maybe add

- Don't make non-needed accounts for websites / use temp mail for these (buying something from a website you rarely visit)
- ***Touch*** on cryptocurrencies / XMR vs BTC

# Other
