- Document Note: In "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" by Ursula K. Le Guin, the author describes the idyllic city of Omelas during its summer festival. While the people of Omelas are happy, they are not simple, naive, or barbaric. The author explores the idea that true happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive. However, there is one child who lives in a basement and suffers horribly so that the rest of Omelas can be happy. The people of Omelas know about the child's suffering and understand that their happiness depends on it.
