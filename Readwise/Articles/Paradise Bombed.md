  this occupation came to be and why it's tolerated by virtually every government on Earth is probably one of the worst stories of Cold War real politic expedience and betrayal of the 20th century ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hd7yq769z45fhex889x091rn))

- one particularly bloody example in 1977 and 78 the Indonesian
  Army conducted a massive bombing campaign over villages in the Balian Valley suspected of being sympathetic to the OPM with the Asia Human Rights Commission estimating that at least 4 000 died but that number is probably a lot higher the report also found that they died not just from bombings but also killed in live burials locked in barrels filled with water and other means that are too brutal to describe here ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdhekd0knj12x9tnkp47hywd))
