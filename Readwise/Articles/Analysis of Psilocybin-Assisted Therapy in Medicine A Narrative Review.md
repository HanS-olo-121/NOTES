## Highlights
- he significance of the upregulation of the mGluR2/3 pathway is the result of the receptor’s abundance in the route from the medial prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens where these receptors play a role in the mediation of craving and addiction, as well as cognitive function [[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8901083/#REF5)]. It has been found that persons with an alcohol addiction have a deficiency or downregulation in their mGluR2 pathway in the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hg260h012h7se5mmxwgnw3nc))

    - Note: Psilocybin increases regulation of mGluR2/3 which plays a role in mediation of craving and addiction.
- Many compounds that fit this description are placed into a category called the 5HT-2A agonists, otherwise known as “classic hallucinogens.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hg1dqvqfjpq81dcp827rqbmf))
- , psilocybin’s effects at the 5HT receptors are responsible for decreased depression and suicidal behaviors, as well as increased memory and learning [[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8901083/#REF11)]. Further, it is believed that psilocin’s activation of the 5HT-2A receptor is responsible for increased release of dopamine from the striatum, which is capable of regulating the defective reward pathway in patients who suffer from depression and with suicidal ideation [[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8901083/#REF6)].

    - Note: The effects on the 5HT (Serotonin) receptors are responsible for decreased sucidality and depression due to an increased release of dopamine through the 5HT-2A receptor
- These compounds, which are often categorized as the “classic hallucinogens,” were used with increasing frequency until their classification as Schedule I substances under the UN Convention on Drugs in 1967 [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8901083#REF1)]. Additionally, following the UN’s classification, many countries included their own laws for restricting or regulating the use of these substances.

- Recently, there has been a resurgence of evidence-based research and clinical trials involving these compounds. “This is a wonderful, fruitful time for discovery because people are suddenly willing to consider these substances as therapeutics again, which hasn’t happened in 50 years,” said Jennifer Mitchell, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco.

- Among those include the treatment of addiction, depression, and end-of-life mood disorders. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hg1e2sydm0r6n6wngx7z8q81))

- A group of compounds that have recently sparked interest for their treatment potential is psychedelic drugs including psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), mescaline, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), among others [[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8901083#REF4)].

- their resemblance to tryptophan enables them to act as serotonin agonists and activate 5HT receptors, mainly the 5HT-2A receptor ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hg1e4nagdj7qmp5ef1vtr6qc))

    - Note: Probably need to research a bit more about these before adding this.
- This effect makes them promising candidates in the treatment of substance abuse disorders as well as mood disorders [[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8901083#REF6)]. This is due to the fact that substance use disorder (SUD) is the manifestation of several neurophysiological mechanisms including the dopaminergic pathways of the striatum (reward center) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hg1e6n8npr2zy5kas9afkc4a))

## New highlights added December 5, 2023 at 9:14 PM
- psilocybin is able to activate G protein-coupled receptors via brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and enable downstream effects such as signal transduction and gene expression [[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8901083/#REF9)]. These changes are potentially responsible for plasticity, regeneration, and neurogenesis. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hg26dkhvk7q8gq65f6qtjjg5))

- Psychedelic therapy models for addiction treatment were heavily researched between 1950 and 1970. However, research in this field came to a halt with the restriction of the classic psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, DMT, etc.) as Schedule I controlled substances in 1970 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hg26fh6nvv6dg84rmrwgnb24))
