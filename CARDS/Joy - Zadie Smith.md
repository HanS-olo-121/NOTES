# Questions about Joy by Zadie Smith

> [!quote] Thesis
> Until quite recently I had known joy only five times in my life, perhaps six, and each time tried to forget it soon after it happened, out of the fear that the memory of it would dement and destroy everything else.

- What is the author's main idea?
	- Pleasure and joy are two separate things, but not mutually exclusive 
- What kind of supporting evidence does the author use?
	- Personal experiences with both sensations, and how intense a feeling can be. Especially when influenced by a psychoactive drug like MDMA. 
- What is the authors main purpose?
	- She much prefers the feeling of pleasure rather than joy. 
- Is the author objective?
	- No, but it is persuasive as she uses her personal experiences in order to convey her point in a more detailed and hopefully relatable way. 
- Who is the audience? Is it more directed towards you or someone else?
	- Definitely not myself
- How is the piece organized?
	-  An introduction, and then talking about the many experiences of joy she had in her life

> [!summary] Summary
In *Joy* by Zadie Smith, it goes over her experiences with the feeling of joy and how it differs from the feeling of pleasure. She goes over her many experiences with joy and why it is such an intense feeling to manage. Pleasure is more of a reoccurring feeling, but joy is a fleeting feeling that disappears as fast as it comes. Examples of such would be eating food is very pleasurable and enjoyable, while being at the nightclub on a psychedelic is in comparison a longer experience, but is not nearly as often as eating would be and is easily a much more intense feeling.
