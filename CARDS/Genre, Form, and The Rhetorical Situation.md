# Genre and Form as Containers

Argument can be present in any text - not just an argumentative essay or academic essay

## Genre and Form 

The "Thesis" or argument in stories are often called themes with a point

Creative works seldom *directly* state their thesis statement. Often, the thesis or argument is revealed through the narrative, plot, or other literary devices. Sometimes as in the case of many nonfiction essays and memoir essays, the thesis or argument isn't suggested until the end of the text


# Rhetorical Situation in Creative Arguments

## New Historicism 

Considering the time period and culture climate that the text arises from

## Purpose 

Think about why the author is writing, To inform? To teach? To examine? to Explore? Creative arguments often wish to do these things. Parables can be considered creative arguments as they don't always want to teach a moral lesson
