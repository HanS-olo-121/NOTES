# Free Write: What is Happiness?

I think the reading put it the best, Happiness is simply a "discrimination of what is necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive." and what we decide is least/most important for our current goals. and use our happiness as a guide to get to our goals. 

# Why would I stay?

You aren't participating if you leave anyway

If I were borne in Omelas, I wouldn't know better. If I were transported to Omelas, sacrificing a single child while over 100s of thousands of children go through this on a daily basis. 

"One thing I know there is none of in Omelas is guilt" so why be upset about the child if there is none to be had? 

Even If you leave you still know the kid is there and will continue to suffer anyway

"Rage and weep" 


The kid does not even know the city thrives on it > it did exist before, it could very well know that it helps the city. 


# Free Write 2: Electric Boogaloo

I would stay in Omelas, I have no qualms about the kid, he's going to suffer no matter what I do anyway. It doesn't seem to matter what I do, so might as well take the guarantied happiness/content feeling rather than risk it by leaving.


# The Bigger Picture

- Omelas provides and allegory for choices dependent on utilitarian morality and a political arrangement in which the suffering of one or few counts as justifiable so long as it provides the pleasures of many. 

# Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism - Actions are justifiable if they benefit the majority 
 
Looks at instrumental value rather than intrinsic value
