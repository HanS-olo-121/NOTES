>[!tip] TL;DR
>The use of the internet has massively changed humanity and how we go about acquiring information. but this can come at a cost of shorter attention span and inability to focus on long passages of text


Extensive internet use can shorten attention span (who knew!) making it harder to get engrossed in many books even if you were an avid reader (like myself)

Web makes research easier

Adds more convenience, and changes more so how you think rather than read:

> [!quote]
> [Scott Karp, who writes a blog about online media](http://publishing2.com/), recently confessed that he has stopped reading books altogether. “I was a lit major in college, and used to be [a] voracious book reader,” he wrote. “What happened?” He speculates on the answer: “What if I do all my reading on the web not so much because the way I read has changed, i.e. I’m just seeking convenience, but because the way I THINK has changed?”

Computer logs showed that many people would skim articles that they find, and then most likely never return. Some would save articles, but there is no evidence they went and came back to it to read it

> [!quote] From Mentioned Study Report
> There are signs that new forms of “reading” are emerging as users “power browse” horizontally through titles, contents pages and abstracts going for quick wins. It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense.


What we read isn't everything that matters, how we read really does. Over time, we have gone from reading long articles to only be able to read a couple paragraphs of a blog due to a **need for "efficiency and immediacy"**

Even the language matters, the Chinese have much different mental circuitry as opposed to one who speaks English, since they use individual characters for words as opposed to letters to form words

>[!important] A Case of Typewriters and Language
>Sometime in 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche bought a typewriter—a Malling-Hansen Writing Ball, to be precise. His vision was failing, and keeping his eyes focused on a page had become exhausting and painful, often bringing on crushing headaches. He had been forced to curtail his writing, and he feared that he would soon have to give it up. The typewriter rescued him, at least for a time. Once he had mastered touch-typing, he was able to write with his eyes closed, using only the tips of his fingers. Words could once again flow from his mind to the page.

Because of this, his writing style would actually change. his writing would go from "arguments to aphorisms, from thoughts to puns, from rhetoric to telegram style."
~ [Friedrich A. Kittler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_A._Kittler), German Media Scholar


The clock is great example of a revelation in the human mind across humankind. It made it so we had an order for things gave a point of reference for actions and thought

> [!example]
> - Go to bed at 10:30pm
> - Wake up at 6:00am 
> - Work at 8am
> - Lunchbreak at 12pm
> - Off work at 5pm
> - Do not work on Saturdays/Sundays
> - Church is Sunday as it is the 7th day

In a sense we lost part of our humanity by going against what we previously learned, its like the old way of keeping time (only based off day and night) we lost a part of us that worked on needs, rather than the time of day it currently is
